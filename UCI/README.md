## R Markdown
    The run_analysis has been coded with a function to read and merge files.<br> The new merged file is given actitvity names from the supporting document and is then written to a seperate location as result.<br> The same way a function is written for getting the mean and standard deviation of variables.<br> The path of each file is manually given as input to the functions as input. Hence the code looks light.<br> A sample is given for verification. The activity names are also included excluding the numbers in the original file.
