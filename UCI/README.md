## R Markdown
    The run_analysis has been coded with a function to read and merge files.\n The new merged file is given actitvity names from the supporting document and is then written to a seperate location as result. The same way a function is written for getting the mean and standard deviation of variables. The path of each file is manually given as input to the functions as input. Hence the code looks light. A sample is given for verification. The activity names are also included excluding the numbers in the original file.
